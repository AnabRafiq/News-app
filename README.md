## 🧠 How It Works

1. On mount, the app fetches **top headlines** using `fetch()` based on selected **country** and **category**.
2. It uses **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state and side effects.
3. **InfiniteScroll** is implemented to dynamically fetch and load more news as the user scrolls.
4. A **loader** is shown while articles are being fetched.
5. If no news articles are found, a user-friendly message is displayed.
